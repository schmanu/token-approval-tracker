# Token Approval Tracker

Prototype of a potential safe app to track and edit ERC20 token approvals.

Current restrictions:
* only supports rinkeby
* only supports 18 decimal tokens
* only fetches the past 50 transactions
* it only fetches the approve transactions and does not check how much of that approval is left.
 

Prototype release:

No guarantees that it works properly. Its still an early prototype.
